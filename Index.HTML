    <h3>Business Management - Professional Writing and Editing</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>My name is Tanner Allen and I am a graduate of BYU-Idaho. I have a bachelor's degree in interdisciplinary studies concentrated in Business Management. I spent much of the first two years of my schooling discovering what I wanted to study. Studying business has been a huge blessing in my life. I am at a stage in my life where I am looking to learn from others as well as the experiences that I will have. I believe that I am a hard-working, honest, and diligent person that can truly add value wherever I find myself.</p>
